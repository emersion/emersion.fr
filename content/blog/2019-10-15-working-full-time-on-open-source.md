**I'll soon be working full-time on open-source software!** I'm pleased to
announce that I'm joining [Sourcehut][sourcehut]. Huge thanks to Drew DeVault
for making this possible. I also want to thank everyone supporting Sourcehut
and allowing it to grow. Being able to do this is pretty crazy, I didn't
think it would be that fast!

My plan is first to continue working and maintaining my current projects. I'll
continue to maintain Wayland & [my Wayland-related tools][wayland-tools]
and I'll still be a Sway & wlroots core contributor. I'll definitely work on
finishing [mrsh] -- it's almost feature-complete. I also want to take care of
my [various Go libraries][go-libs].

I also plan to expand my activity to new projects. I'll help Drew DeVault with
his work on VR for Wayland. Depending on the bandwidth available, I'd like to
contribute to sr.ht, work on an interactive shell based on mrsh, and continue
my efforts with [libliftoff].

It's hard to say how happy I am to start working on all of these projects
full-time. I would have laughed at anybody saying things would end up this way
three years ago. I hope that thanks to this extra time I'll be able to make
significant contributions and help move the ecosystem forward!
